# A Numerical Transformation-Based Method for Distance Measurement in Repetitive Arrangements
## Abstract
In this study, a novel distance metric is proposed for measuring the distance between repetitive arrangements. Unlike traditional distance metrics, **the proposed method facilitates distance measurement by converting repetitive arrangements into integers without data loss (preserving order and repetition count). This transformation enables precise distance measurement and relational analysis**. The applicability of the method is discussed in fields such as bioinformatics, natural language processing, data compression, encryption, and optimization. The similarities and differences between traditional methods and the proposed method are examined. Results reveal that the proposed method provides a complete and efficient distance measurement for repetitive arrangements. The study thoroughly explores the mathematical model of the method, ensures its algorithmic implementation, and supports it with examples.
